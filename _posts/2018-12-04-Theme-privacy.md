We collect the following information to provide you an enhanced user experience and better services as well as to improve our products.


## I. Product Metrics 

We collect data about how you and your device interact with our products. This includes (1) device information such as manufacturer, model, OS version, language settings, nation settings and applications installed, (2) data regarding our application such as version and installation source, and (3) your interaction data such as views, duration of stay at views, transition from view to view and how you enter and leave the view. The data collected helps us know which functions you like and which functions to improve. This information allows us to improve our products and provide you a better user experience. All data is encrypted before being stored locally or transferred to our servers for analysis. Only authorized personnel can access the summarized data with the original data regarding your interactions destroyed periodically. 

## II. Feedback Data 

We use Zendesk as the feedback platform as we recognize your trust and suggestions make us better. This platform allows our well trained support team members to interact with you. We collect the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback, questions or information you provide for customer support. When you contact us for customer support, phone conversations or chat sessions with our representatives may be monitored and recorded. 

## III. Crash Data 

We use Google Fabric to collect crash data from some users. This helps us improve our products and services for all users.

To avoid showing the same notification twice to you, we use the installed App list, locally, to check if there are the similar themes in the system. The information of installed themes might be encrypted and sent to the server.
